# Architect bootstrap starter theme with fixed navbar

Based on [`jasonlong/architect-theme`](https://github.com/jasonlong/architect-theme), similar to [`pages-themes/architect`](https://github.com/pages-themes/architect), with quick adaptations to use [Bootstrap with navbar-fixed](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/navbar-fixed/), improve printing style, and other minor updates by @brodybits (Christopher J. Brody aka Chris Brody).
